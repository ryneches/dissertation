Abstract = {{The identification of the prokaryotic species which constitute marine

   bacterioplankton communities has been a long-standing problem in marine

   microbiology.  To address this question, we used the polymerase chain

   rRNA genes cloned from Sargasso Sea bacterioplankton genomic DNA. 

   Oligonucleotides complementary to conserved regions in the 16S rDNAs of

   eubacteria were used to direct the synthesis of polymerase chain

   reaction products, which were then cloned by blunt-end ligation into

   the phagemid vector pBluescript.  Restriction fragment length

   polymorphisms and hybridizations to oligonucleotide probes for the

   SAR11 and marine Synechococcus phylogenetic groups indicated the

   presence of at least seven classes of genes.  The sequences of five

   unique rDNAs were determined completely.  In addition to 16S rRNA genes

   from the marine Synechococcus cluster and the previously identified but

   uncultivated microbial group, the SAR11 cluster {[}S. J.  Giovannoni,

   comparisons indicated that these belonged to unknown species of alpha-

   and gamma-proteobacteria.  The data confirm the earlier conclusion that

   a majority of planktonic bacteria are new species previously

   unrecognized by bacteriologists.}},

@article{Campbell1999Genome,
	abstract = {Our basic observation is that each genome has a characteristic “signature” defined as the ratios between the observed dinucleotide frequencies and the frequencies expected if neighbors were chosen at random (dinucleotide relative abundances). The remarkable fact is that the signature is relatively constant throughout the genome; i.e., the patterns and levels of dinucleotide relative abundances of every 50-kb segment of the genome are about the same. Comparison of the signatures of different genomes provides a measure of similarity which has the advantage that it looks at all the DNA of an organism and does not depend on the ability to align homologous sequences of specific genes. Genome signature comparisons show that plasmids, both specialized and broad-range, and their hosts have substantially compatible (similar) genome signatures. Mammalian mitochondrial (Mt) genomes are very similar, and animal and fungal Mt are generally moderately similar, but they diverge significantly from plant and protist Mt sets. Moreover, Mt genome signature differences between species parallel the corresponding nuclear genome signature differences, despite large differences between Mt and host nuclear signatures. In signature terms, we find that the archaea are not a coherent clade. For example,  and  are extremely divergent. There is no consistent pattern of signature differences among thermophiles. More generally, grouping prokaryotes by environmental criteria (e.g., habitat propensities, osmolarity tolerance, chemical conditions) reveals no correlations in genome signature.},

@article{Huse2008Exploring,
	abstract = {Massively parallel pyrosequencing of hypervariable regions from small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes can sample a microbial community two or three orders of magnitude more deeply per dollar and per hour than capillary sequencing of full-length SSU rRNA. As with full-length rRNA surveys, each sequence read is a tag surrogate for a single microbe. However, rather than assigning taxonomy by creating gene trees de novo that include all experimental sequences and certain reference taxa, we compare the hypervariable region tags to an extensive database of rRNA sequences and assign taxonomy based on the best match in a Global Alignment for Sequence Taxonomy (GAST) process. The resulting taxonomic census provides information on both composition and diversity of the microbial community. To determine the effectiveness of using only hypervariable region tags for assessing microbial community membership, we compared the taxonomy assigned to the V3 and V6 hypervariable regions with the taxonomy assigned to full-length SSU rRNA sequences isolated from both the human gut and a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. The hypervariable region tags and full-length rRNA sequences provided equivalent taxonomy and measures of relative abundance of microbial communities, even for tags up to 15\% divergent from their nearest reference match. The greater sampling depth per dollar afforded by massively parallel pyrosequencing reveals many more members of the “rare biosphere” than does capillary sequencing of the full-length gene. In addition, tag sequencing eliminates cloning bias and the sequences are short enough to be completely sequenced in a single read, maximizing the number of organisms sampled in a run while minimizing chimera formation. This technique allows the cost-effective exploration of changes in microbial community structure, including the rare biosphere, over space and time and can be applied immediately to initiatives, such as the Human Microbiome Project.},

@article{Yooseph2007Sorcerer,
	abstract = {Metagenomics projects based on shotgun sequencing of populations of micro-organisms yield insight into protein families. We used sequence similarity clustering to explore proteins with a comprehensive dataset consisting of sequences from available databases together with 6.12 million proteins predicted from an assembly of 7.7 million Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) sequences. The GOS dataset covers nearly all known prokaryotic protein families. A total of 3,995 medium- and large-sized clusters consisting of only GOS sequences are identified, out of which 1,700 have no detectable homology to known families. The GOS-only clusters contain a higher than expected proportion of sequences of viral origin, thus reflecting a poor sampling of viral diversity until now. Protein domain distributions in the GOS dataset and current protein databases show distinct biases. Several protein domains that were previously categorized as kingdom specific are shown to have GOS examples in other kingdoms. About 6,000 sequences (ORFans) from the literature that heretofore lacked similarity to known proteins have matches in the GOS data. The GOS dataset is also used to improve remote homology detection. Overall, besides nearly doubling the number of current proteins, the predicted GOS proteins also add a great deal of diversity to known protein families and shed light on their evolution. These observations are illustrated using several protein families, including phosphatases, proteases, ultraviolet-irradiation DNA damage repair enzymes, glutamine synthetase, and RuBisCO. The diversity added by GOS data has implications for choosing targets for experimental structure characterization as part of structural genomics efforts. Our analysis indicates that new families are being discovered at a rate that is linear or almost linear with the addition of new sequences, implying that we are still far from discovering all protein families in nature.},

@article{Not0000Vertical,
	abstract = {Summary Eukaryotic molecular diversity within the picoplanktonic size-fraction has primarily been studied in marine surface waters. Here, the vertical distribution of picoeukaryotic diversity was investigated in the Sargasso Sea from euphotic to abyssal waters, using size-fractionated samples (< 2 mum). 18S rRNA gene clone libraries were used to generate sequences from euphotic zone samples (deep chlorophyll maximum to the surface); the permanent thermocline (500 m); and the pelagic deep-sea (3000 m). Euphotic zone and deep-sea data contrasted strongly, the former displaying greater diversity at the first-rank taxon level, based on 232 nearly full-length sequences. Deep-sea sequences belonged almost exclusively to the Alveolata and Radiolaria, while surface samples also contained known and putative photosynthetic groups, such as unique Chlorarachniophyta and Chrysophyceae sequences. Phylogenetic analyses placed most Alveolata and Stramenopile sequences within previously reported 'environmental' clades, i.e. clades within the Novel Alveolate groups I and II (NAI and NAII), or the novel Marine Stramenopiles (MAST). However, some deep-sea NAII formed distinct, bootstrap supported clades. Stramenopiles were recovered from the euphotic zone only, although many MAST are reportedly heterotrophic, making the observed distribution a point for further investigation. An unexpectedly high proportion of radiolarian sequences were recovered. From these, five environmental radiolarian clades, RAD-I to RAD-V, were identified. RAD-IV and RAD-V were composed of Taxopodida-like sequences, with the former solely containing Sargasso Sea sequences, although from all depth zones sampled. Our findings highlight the vast diversity of these protists, most of which remain uncultured and of unknown ecological function.},

@article{Noonan2006Sequencing,
	abstract = {Our knowledge of Neanderthals is based on a limited number of remains and artifacts from which we must make inferences about their biology, behavior, and relationship to ourselves. Here, we describe the characterization of these extinct hominids from a new perspective, based on the development of a Neanderthal metagenomic library and its high-throughput sequencing and analysis. Several lines of evidence indicate that the 65,250 base pairs of hominid sequence so far identified in the library are of Neanderthal origin, the strongest being the ascertainment of sequence identities between Neanderthal and chimpanzee at sites where the human genomic sequence is different. These results enabled us to calculate the human-Neanderthal divergence time based on multiple randomly distributed autosomal loci. Our analyses suggest that on average the Neanderthal genomic sequence we obtained and the reference human genome sequence share a most recent common ancestor approximately 706,000 years ago, and that the human and Neanderthal ancestral populations split approximately 370,000 years ago, before the emergence of anatomically modern humans. Our finding that the Neanderthal and human genomes are at least 99.5\% identical led us to develop and successfully implement a targeted method for recovering specific ancient DNA sequences from metagenomic libraries. This initial analysis of the Neanderthal genome advances our understanding of the evolutionary relationship of Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis and signifies the dawn of Neanderthal genomics.},

This technique is based on the separation of polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments of genes coding for 16S rRNA, all the same length, by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE analysis of different microbial communities demonstrated the presence of up to 10 distinguishable bands in the separation pattern, which were most likely derived from as many different species constituting these populations, and thereby generated a DGGE profile of the populations. We showed that it is possible to identify constituents which represent only 1\% of the total population. With an oligonucleotide probe specific for the V3 region of 16S rRNA of sulfate-reducing bacteria, particular DNA fragments from some of the microbial populations could be identified by hybridization analysis. Analysis of the genomic DNA from a bacterial biofilm grown under aerobic conditions suggests that sulfate-reducing bacteria, despite their anaerobicity, were present in this environment. The results we obtained demonstrate that this technique will contribute to our understanding of the genetic diversity of uncharacterized microbial populations.},

@article{Gupta2002Critical,
	abstract = {To understand bacterial phylogeny, it is essential that the following two critical issues be resolved: (i) development of well-defined (molecular) criteria for identifying the main groups within Bacteria, and (ii) to understand how the different main groups are related to each other and how they branched off from a common ancestor. These issues are not resolved at present. We have recently described a new approach, based on shared conserved inserts and deletions (indels or signature sequences) found in various proteins, that provides a reliable means for understanding these issues. A large number of conserved indels that are shared by different groups of bacteria have been identified. Using these indels, and based simply on their presence or absence, all of the main groups within Bacteria can be defined in clear molecular terms and new species could be assigned to them with minimal ambiguity. The analysis of these indels also permits one to logically deduce that the various main bacterial groups have branched off from a common ancestor in the following order: Low G+C Gram-positive ==> High G+C Gram-positive ==> Clostridium-Fusobacteria-Thermotoga ==> Deinococcus-Thermus-Green nonsulfur bacteria ==> Cyanobacteria ==> Spirochetes ==> Chlamydia-Cytophaga-Bacteroides-Green sulfur bacteria ==> Aquifex ==> Proteobacteria 1 (epsilon and delta) ==> Proteobacteria-2. (alpha) ==> Proteobacteria-3 (beta) and ==> Proteobacteria-4 (gamma). The validity of this approach was tested using sequence data from bacterial genomes. By making use of 18 conserved indels, species from all 60 completed bacterial genomes were assigned to different groups. The observed distribution of these indels in different species was then compared with that predicted by the model. Of the 936 observations concerning the placement of these indels in various species, all except one were in accordance with the model. The placement of bacteria into different groups using this approach also showed excellent correlation with the 16S rRNA phylogenies with nearly all of the species assigned to the same groups by both methods. These results provide strong evidence that the genes containing these indels have not been affected by factors such as lateral gene transfers. However, such events are readily detected by this means and some examples are provided. The approach described here thus provides a reliable and internally consistent means for understanding various critical and long outstanding issues in bacterial phylogeny.},

@book{Sorensen2007Likelihood,
	abstract = {{Over the last ten years the introduction of computer intensive statistical methods has opened new horizons concerning the probability models that can be fitted to genetic data, the scale of the problems that can be tackled and the nature of the questions that can be posed. In particular, the application of Bayesian and likelihood methods to statistical genetics has been facilitated enormously by these methods. Techniques generally referred to as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) have played a major role in this process, stimulating synergies among scientists in different fields, such as mathematicians, probabilists, statisticians, computer scientists and statistical geneticists. Specifically, the MCMC "revolution" has made a deep impact in quantitative genetics. This can be seen, for example, in the vast number of papers dealing with complex hierarchical models and models for detection of genes affecting quantitative or meristic traits in plants, animals and humans that have been published recently. This book, suitable for numerate biologists and for applied statisticians, provides the foundations of likelihood, Bayesian and MCMC methods in the context of genetic analysis of quantitative traits. Most students in biology and agriculture lack the formal background needed to learn these modern biometrical techniques. Although a number of excellent texts in these areas have become available in recent years, the basic ideas and tools are typically described in a technically demanding style, and have been written by and addressed to professional statisticians. For this reason, considerable more detail is offered than what may be warranted for a more mathematically apt audience. The book is divided into four parts. Part I gives a review of probability and distribution theory. Parts II and III present methods of inference and MCMC methods. Part IV discusses several models that can be applied in quantitative genetics, primarily from a Bayesian perspective. An effort has been made to relate biological to statistical parameters throughout, and examples are used profusely to motivate the developments. Daniel Sorensen is a Research Professor in Statistical Genetics, at the Department of Animal Breeding and Genetics in the Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences. Daniel Gianola is Professor in the Animal Sciences, Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, and Dairy Science Departments of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Gianola and Sorensen pioneered the introduction of Bayesian and MCMC methods in animal breeding.

	abstract = {A basic problem of the metagenomic approach in microbial ecology is the assignment of genomic fragments to a certain species or taxonomic group, when suitable marker genes are absent. Currently, the (G + C)-content together with phylogenetic information and codon adaptation for functional genes is mostly used to assess the relationship of different fragments. These methods, however, can produce ambiguous results. In order to evaluate sequence-based methods for fragment identification, we extensively compared (G + C)-contents and tetranucleotide usage patterns of 9054 fosmid-sized genomic fragments generated in silico from 118 completely sequenced bacterial genomes (40 982 931 fragment pairs were compared in total). The results of this systematic study show that the discriminatory power of correlations of tetranucleotide-derived z-scores is by far superior to that of differences in (G + C)-content and provides reasonable assignment probabilities when applied to metagenome libraries of small diversity. Using six fully sequenced fosmid inserts from a metagenomic analysis of microbial consortia mediating the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), we demonstrate that discrimination based on tetranucleotide-derived z-score correlations was consistent with corresponding data from 16S ribosomal RNA sequence analysis and allowed us to discriminate between fosmid inserts that were indistinguishable with respect to their (G + C)-contents.},

A naive Bayesian classifier was built to discriminate between different bacterial compositions of short oligomers, also known as DNA words. The classifier has proven successful in identifying foreign genes in Neisseria meningitis. In this study we extend the classifier approach using either a fixed higher order Markov model (Mk) or a variable length Markov model (VLMk).  Results: We propose a simple algorithm to lock a variable length Markov model to a certain number of parameters and show that the use of Markov models greatly increases the flexibility and accuracy in prediction to that of a naive model. We also test the integrity of classifiers in terms of false-negatives and give estimates of the minimal sizes of training data. We end the report by proposing a method to reject a false hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer.

Evolutionary theory predicts the inevitability of false positives when essential sequences are strongly conserved. Foreign genes could become more detectable on the basis of their higher order compositions if such features ameliorate more rapidly and uniformly than lower order features. This possibility is tested by comparing the heterogeneities of bacterial genomes with respect to strand-independent first- and second-order features, (i) G + C content and (ii) dinucleotide relative abundance, in 1 kb segments. Although statistical analysis confirms that (ii) is less inhomogeneous than (i) in all 12 species examined, extreme anomalies with respect to (ii) in the Escherichia coli K12 genome are typically co-located with essential genes. 10.1093/dnares/dsn021},

The step of clustering these sequences, based on biological and molecular features, is called binning. A reported strategy for binning that combines oligonucleotide frequency and self-organising maps (SOM) shows high potential. We improve this strategy by identifying suitable training features, implementing a better clustering algorithm, and defining quantitative measures for assessing results. We investigated the suitability of each of di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentanucleotide frequencies. The results show that dinucleotide frequency is not a sufficiently strong signature for binning 10 kb long DNA sequences, compared to the other three. Furthermore, we observed that increased order of oligonucleotide frequency may deteriorate the assignment result in some cases, which indicates the possible existence of optimal species-specific oligonucleotide frequency. We replaced SOM with growing self-organising map (GSOM) where comparable results are obtained while gaining 7\%-15\% speed improvement.},

Based on these differences in oligonucleotide frequency between bacterial genomes, we investigated the possibility of predicting the genome of origin for a specific genomic sequence. To this end, we developed a na\"{i}ve Bayesian classifier and systematically analyzed 28 eubacterial and archaeal genomes. We found that sequences as short as 400 bases could be correctly classified with an accuracy of 85\%. We then applied the classifier to the identification of horizontal gene transfer events in whole-genome sequences and demonstrated the validity of our approach by correctly predicting the transfer of both the superoxide dismutase (sodC) and the bioC gene from Haemophilus influenzae to Neisseria meningitis, correctly identifying both the donor and recipient species.

The dinucleotide composition was significantly different between the organisms. The distribution of genes from an organism was clustered around its center in the dinucleotide composition space. The genes from closely related organisms such as Gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma species and eukaryotes showed some overlap in the space. The genes from nine complete genomes together with those from human were discriminated into respective clusters with 80\% accuracy using the dinucleotide composition alone. The composition data estimated from a whole genome was close to that obtained from genes, indicating that the characteristic feature of dinucleotides holds not only for protein coding regions but also noncoding regions. When a dendrogram was constructed from the disposition of the clusters in the dinucleotide space, it resembled the real phylogenetic tree. Thus, the distinct feature observed in the dinucleotide composition may reflect the phylogenetic relationship of organisms. 10.1093/dnares/5.5.251},

@article{Li2008Probing,
	abstract = {Background: The scale and diversity of metagenomic sequencing projects challenge both our technical and conceptual approaches in gene and genome annotations. The recent Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition yielded millions of predicted protein sequences, which significantly altered the landscape of known protein space by more than doubling its size and adding thousands of new families (Yooseph et al., 2007 PLoS Biol 5, e16). Such datasets, not only by their sheer size, but also by many other features, defy conventional analysis and annotation methods. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we describe an approach for rapid analysis of the sequence diversity and the internal structure of such very large datasets by advanced clustering strategies using the newly modified CD-HIT algorithm. We performed a hierarchical clustering analysis on the 17.4 million Open Reading Frames (ORFs) identified from the GOS study and found over 33 thousand large predicted protein clusters comprising nearly 6 million sequences. Twenty percent of these clusters did not match known protein families by sequence similarity search and might represent novel protein families. Distributions of the large clusters were illustrated on organism composition, functional class, and sample locations. Conclusion/Significance: Our clustering took about two orders of magnitude less computational effort than the similar protein family analysis of original GOS study. This approach will help to analyze other large metagenomic datasets in the future. A Web server with our clustering results and annotations of predicted protein clusters is available online at http://tools.camera.calit2.net/gos under the CAMERA project.},

@article{Abe2003Informatics,
	abstract = {With the increasing amount of available genome sequences, novel tools are needed for comprehensive analysis of species-specific sequence characteristics for a wide variety of genomes. We used an unsupervised neural network algorithm, a self-organizing map (SOM), to analyze di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide frequencies in a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. The SOM, which can cluster complex data efficiently, was shown to be an excellent tool for analyzing global characteristics of genome sequences and for revealing key combinations of oligonucleotides representing individual genomes. From analysis of 1- and 10-kb genomic sequences derived from 65 bacteria (a total of 170 Mb) and from 6 eukaryotes (460 Mb), clear species-specific separations of major portions of the sequences were obtained with the di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide SOMs. The unsupervised algorithm could recognize, in most 10-kb sequences, the species-specific characteristics (key combinations of oligonucleotide frequencies) that are signature features of each genome. We were able to classify DNA sequences within one and between many species into subgroups that corresponded generally to biological categories. Because the classification power is very high, the SOM is an efficient and fundamental bioinformatic strategy for extracting a wide range of genomic information from a vast amount of sequences.},

@article{Pride2003Evolutionary,
	abstract = {We compared nucleotide usage pattern conservation for related prokaryotes by examining the representation of DNA tetranucleotide combinations in 27 representative microbial genomes. For each of the organisms studied, tetranucleotide usage departures from expectations (TUD) were shared between related organisms using both Markov chain analysis and a zero-order Markov method. Individual strains, multiple chromosomes, plasmids, and bacteriophages share TUDs within a species. TUDs varied between coding and noncoding DNA. Grouping prokaryotes based on TUD profiles resulted in relationships with important differences from those based on 16S rRNA phylogenies, which may reflect unequal rates of evolution of nucleotide usage patterns following divergence of particular organisms from a common ancestor. By both symmetrical tree distance and likelihood analysis, phylogenetic trees based on TUD profiles demonstrate a level of congruence with 16S rRNA trees similar to that of both RpoA and RecA trees. Congruence of these trees indicates that there exists phylogenetic signal in TUD patterns, most prominent in coding region DNA. Because relationships demonstrated in TUD-based analyses utilize whole genomes, they should be considered complementary to phylogenies based on single genetic elements, such as 16S rRNA.},

@article{Jernigan2002Pervasive,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The dinucleotide relative abundance profile can be regarded as a genomic signature because, despite diversity between species, it varies little between 50 kilobase or longer windows on a given genome. Both the causes and the functional significance of this phenomenon could be illuminated by determining if it persists on smaller scales. The profile is computed from the base step "odds ratios" that compare dinucleotide frequencies to those expected under the assumption of stochastic equilibrium (thorough shuffling). Analysis is carried out on 22 sequences, representing 19 species and comprised of about 53 million bases all together, to assess stability of the signature in windows ranging in size from 50 kilobases down to 125 bases.RESULTS:Dinucleotide relative abundance distance from the global signature is computed locally for all non-overlapping windows on each sequence. These distances are log-normally distributed with nearly constant variance and with means that tend to zero slower than reciprocal square root of window size. The mean distance within genomes is larger for protist, plant, and human chromosomes, and smaller for archaea, bacteria, and yeast, for any window size.CONCLUSIONS:The imprint of the global signature is locally pervasive on all scales considered in the sequences (either genomes or chromosomes) that were scanned.},

@article{Kariin1995Dinucleotide,
	abstract = {Early biochemical experiments established that the set of dinucleotide odds ratios or `general design' is a remarkably stable property of the DNA of an organism, which is essentially the same in protein-coding DNA, bulk genomic DNA, and in different renaturation rale and density gradient fractions of genomic DNA in many organisms. Analysis of currently available genomic sequence data has extended these earlier results, showing that the general designs of disjoint samples of a genome are substantially more similar to each other than to those of sequences from other organisms and that closely related organisms have similar general designs. From this perspective, the set of dinucleotide odds ratio (relative abundance) values constitute a signature of each DNA genome, which can discriminate between sequences from different organisms. Dinucleotide-odds ratio values appear to reflect not only the chemistry of dinucleotide stacking energies and base-step conformational preferences, but also the species-specific properties of DNA modification, replication and repair mechanisms.},

@article{Teeling2004TETRA,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the emerging field of environmental genomics, direct cloning and sequencing of genomic fragments from complex microbial communities has proven to be a valuable source of new enzymes, expanding the knowledge of basic biological processes. The central problem of this so called metagenome-approach is that the cloned fragments often lack suitable phylogenetic marker genes, rendering the identification of clones that are likely to originate from the same genome difficult or impossible. In such cases, the analysis of intrinsic DNA-signatures like tetranucleotide frequencies can provide valuable hints on fragment affiliation. With this application in mind, the TETRA web-service and the TETRA stand-alone program have been developed, both of which automate the task of comparative tetranucleotide frequency analysis. Availability: http://www.megx.net/tetra. RESULTS: TETRA provides a statistical analysis of tetranucleotide usage patterns in genomic fragments, either via a web-service or a stand-alone program. With respect to discriminatory power, such an analysis outperforms the assignment of genomic fragments based on the (G+C)-content, which is a widely-used sequence-based measure for assessing fragment relatedness. While the web-service is restricted to the calculation of correlation coefficients between tetranucleotide usage patterns of submitted DNA sequences, the stand-alone program generates a much more detailed output, comprising all raw data and graphical plots. The stand-alone program is controlled via a graphical user interface and can batch-process a multitude of sequences. Furthermore, it comes with pre-computed tetranucleotide usage patterns for 166 prokaryote chromosomes, providing a useful reference dataset and source for data-mining. CONCLUSIONS: Up to now, the analysis of skewed oligonucleotide distributions within DNA sequences is not a commonly used tool within metagenomics. With the TETRA web-service and stand-alone program, the method is now accessible in an easy to use manner for a broad audience. This will hopefully facilitate the interrelation of genomic fragments from metagenome libraries, ultimately leading to new insights into the genetic potentials of yet uncultured microorganisms.},

@article{Rusch2007Sorcerer,
	abstract = {The world\&\#39;s oceans contain a complex mixture of micro-organisms that are for the most part, uncharacterized both genetically and biochemically. We report here a metagenomic study of the marine planktonic microbiota in which surface (mostly marine) water samples were analyzed as part of the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling expedition. These samples, collected across a several-thousand km transect from the North Atlantic through the Panama Canal and ending in the South Pacific yielded an extensive dataset consisting of 7.7 million sequencing reads (6.3 billion bp). Though a few major microbial clades dominate the planktonic marine niche, the dataset contains great diversity with 85\&\#37; of the assembled sequence and 57\&\#37; of the unassembled data being unique at a 98\&\#37; sequence identity cutoff. Using the metadata associated with each sample and sequencing library, we developed new comparative genomic and assembly methods. One comparative genomic method, termed \&\#8220;fragment recruitment,\&\#8221; addressed questions of genome structure, evolution, and taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity, as well as the biochemical diversity of genes and gene families. A second method, termed \&\#8220;extreme assembly,\&\#8221; made possible the assembly and reconstruction of large segments of abundant but clearly nonclonal organisms. Within all abundant populations analyzed, we found extensive intra-ribotype diversity in several forms: (1) extensive sequence variation within orthologous regions throughout a given genome; despite coverage of individual ribotypes approaching 500-fold, most individual sequencing reads are unique; (2) numerous changes in gene content some with direct adaptive implications; and (3) hypervariable genomic islands that are too variable to assemble. The intra-ribotype diversity is organized into genetically isolated populations that have overlapping but independent distributions, implying distinct environmental preference. We present novel methods for measuring the genomic similarity between metagenomic samples and show how they may be grouped into several community types. Specific functional adaptations can be identified both within individual ribotypes and across the entire community, including proteorhodopsin spectral tuning and the presence or absence of the phosphate-binding gene PstS.},

@article{Wu2006Metabolic,
	abstract = {Mutualistic intracellular symbiosis between bacteria and insects is a widespread phenomenon that has contributed to the global success of insects. The symbionts, by provisioning nutrients lacking from diets, allow various insects to occupy or dominate ecological niches that might otherwise be unavailable. One such insect is the glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca coagulata), which feeds on xylem fluid, a diet exceptionally poor in organic nutrients. Phylogenetic studies based on rRNA have shown two types of bacterial symbionts to be coevolving with sharpshooters: the gamma-proteobacterium Baumannia cicadellinicola and the Bacteroidetes species Sulcia muelleri. We report here the sequencing and analysis of the 686,192-base pair genome of B. cicadellinicola and approximately 150 kilobase pairs of the small genome of S. muelleri, both isolated from H. coagulata. Our study, which to our knowledge is the first genomic analysis of an obligate symbiosis involving multiple partners, suggests striking complementarity in the biosynthetic capabilities of the two symbionts: B. cicadellinicola devotes a substantial portion of its genome to the biosynthesis of vitamins and cofactors required by animals and lacks most amino acid biosynthetic pathways, whereas S. muelleri apparently produces most or all of the essential amino acids needed by its host. This finding, along with other results of our genome analysis, suggests the existence of metabolic codependency among the two unrelated endosymbionts and their insect host. This dual symbiosis provides a model case for studying correlated genome evolution and genome reduction involving multiple organisms in an intimate, obligate mutualistic relationship. In addition, our analysis provides insight for the first time into the differences in symbionts between insects (e.g., aphids) that feed on phloem versus those like H. coagulata that feed on xylem. Finally, the genomes of these two symbionts provide potential targets for controlling plant pathogens such as Xylella fastidiosa, a major agroeconomic problem, for which H. coagulata and other sharpshooters serve as vectors of transmission.},

Here, using random shotgun sequencing of DNA from a natural acidophilic biofilm, we report reconstruction of near-complete genomes of Leptospirillum group II and Ferroplasma type II, and partial recovery of three other genomes. This was possible because the biofilm was dominated by a small number of species populations and the frequency of genomic rearrangements and gene insertions or deletions was relatively low. Because each sequence read came from a different individual, we could determine that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are the predominant form of heterogeneity at the strain level. The Leptospirillum group II genome had remarkably few nucleotide polymorphisms, despite the existence of low-abundance variants. The Ferroplasma type II genome seems to be a composite from three ancestral strains that have undergone homologous recombination to form a large population of mosaic genomes.

A protocol is described for rapidly generating large blocks of 16S rRNA sequence data without isolation of the 16S rRNA or cloning of its gene. The 16S rRNA in bulk cellular RNA preparations is selectively targeted for dideoxynucleotide-terminated sequencing by using reverse transcriptase and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide primers complementary to universally conserved 16S rRNA sequences. Three particularly useful priming sites, which provide access to the three major 16S rRNA structural domains, routinely yield 800-1000 nucleotides of 16S rRNA sequence. The method is evaluated with respect to accuracy, sensitivity to modified nucleotides in the template RNA, and phylogenetic usefulness, by examination of several 16S rRNAs whose gene sequences are known. The relative simplicity of this approach should facilitate a rapid expansion of the 16S rRNA sequence collection available for phylogenetic analyses.},

@article{Richter2008MetaSimA,
	abstract = {Background: The new research field of metagenomics is providing exciting insights into various, previously unclassified ecological systems. Next-generation sequencing technologies are producing a rapid increase of environmental data in public databases. There is great need for specialized software solutions and statistical methods for dealing with complex metagenome data sets. Methodology/Principal Findings: To facilitate the development and improvement of metagenomic tools and the planning of metagenomic projects, we introduce a sequencing simulator called MetaSim. Our software can be used to generate collections of synthetic reads that reflect the diverse taxonomical composition of typical metagenome data sets. Based on a database of given genomes, the program allows the user to design a metagenome by specifying the number of genomes present at different levels of the NCBI taxonomy, and then to collect reads from the metagenome using a simulation of a number of different sequencing technologies. A population sampler optionally produces evolved sequences based on source genomes and a given evolutionary tree. Conclusions/Significance: MetaSim allows the user to simulate individual read datasets that can be used as standardized test scenarios for planning sequencing projects or for benchmarking metagenomic software.},

We assembled sampled reads using three commonly used genome assemblers (Phrap, Arachne and JAZZ), and predicted genes using two popular gene-finding pipelines (fgenesb and CRITICA/GLIMMER). The phylogenetic origins of the assembled contigs were predicted using one sequence similarity-based (blast hit distribution) and two sequence composition-based (PhyloPythia, oligonucleotide frequencies) binning methods. We explored the effects of the simulated community structure and method combinations on the fidelity of each processing step by comparison to the corresponding isolate genomes.

@article{Huson2007MEGAN,
	abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a sample of organisms obtained from a common habitat using targeted or random sequencing. Goals include understanding the extent and role of microbial diversity. The taxonomical content of such a sample is usually estimated by comparison against sequence databases of known sequences. Most published studies use the analysis of paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid and BAC clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput are paving the way to low-cost random "shotgun" approaches. This paper introduces MEGAN, a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic data sets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA sequences is compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison tool. MEGAN is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical content of the data set, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm assigns reads to taxa such that the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the level of conservation of the sequence. The software allows large data sets to be dissected without the need for assembly or the targeting of specific phylogenetic markers. It provides graphical and statistical output for comparing different data sets. The approach is applied to several data sets, including the Sargasso Sea data set, a recently published metagenomic data set sampled from a mammoth bone, and several complete microbial genomes. Also, simulations that evaluate the performance of the approach for different read lengths are presented.},

been that the
vast majority of microbes cannot be cultured in the laboratory and thus
are not amenable to traditional methods of characterization.
Environmental shotgun sequencing (ESS) overcomes this hurdle by
sequencing the DNA from the organisms present in a microbial community.
The interpretation of this metagenomic data can be greatly facilitated
by associating every sequence read with its source organism. We report
the development of CompostBin, a DNA composition-based algorithm for
analyzing metagenomic sequence reads and distributing them into
taxon-specific bins. Unlike previous methods that seek to bin assembled
contigs and often require training on known reference genomes,
CompostBin has the ability to accurately bin raw sequence reads without
need for assembly or training. It applies principal component analysis
to project the data into an informative lower-dimensional space, and
then uses the normalized cut clustering algorithm on this filtered data
set to classify sequences into taxon-specific bins. We demonstrate the
algorithm's accuracy on a variety of simulated data sets and on one
metagenomic data set with known species assignments. CompostBin is a
work in progress, with several refinements of the algorithm planned for
the future.},

Three particularly useful priming sites, which provide access to the three major 16S rRNA structural domains, routinely yield 800-1000 nucleotides of 16S rRNA sequence. The method is evaluated with respect to accuracy, sensitivity to modified nucleotides in the template RNA, and phylogenetic usefulness, by examination of several 16S rRNAs whose gene sequences are known. The relative simplicity of this approach should facilitate a rapid expansion of the 16S rRNA sequence collection available for phylogenetic analyses.},

@article{Handelsman2004Review,
	abstract = {Metagenomics (also referred to as environmental and community genomics) is the genomic analysis of microorganisms by direct extraction and cloning of DNA from an assemblage of microorganisms. The development of metagenomics stemmed from the ineluctable evidence that as-yet-uncultured microorganisms represent the vast majority of organisms in most environments on earth. This evidence was derived from analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified directly from the environment, an approach that avoided the bias imposed by culturing and led to the discovery of vast new lineages of microbial life. Although the portrait of the microbial world was revolutionized by analysis of 16S rRNA genes, such studies yielded only a phylogenetic description of community membership, providing little insight into the genetics, physiology, and biochemistry of the members. Metagenomics provides a second tier of technical innovation that facilitates study of the physiology and ecology of environmental microorganisms. Novel genes and gene products discovered through metagenomics include the first bacteriorhodopsin of bacterial origin; novel small molecules with antimicrobial activity; and new members of families of known proteins, such as an Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) antiporter, RecA, DNA polymerase, and antibiotic resistance determinants. Reassembly of multiple genomes has provided insight into energy and nutrient cycling within the community, genome structure, gene function, population genetics and microheterogeneity, and lateral gene transfer among members of an uncultured community. The application of metagenomic sequence information will facilitate the design of better culturing strategies to link genomic analysis with pure culture studies.},
