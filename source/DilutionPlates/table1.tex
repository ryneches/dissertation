\caption{\textbf{Detailed breakdown of operations for DNA sample normalization.} These times are based on personal observations; there are no doubt technicians who can work faster than I can, and there are no doubt robots that are faster than the ones I have observed. Nevertheless, these times should serve as a reasonable estimate of how quickly a technician working carefully would work over the course of a session.}
