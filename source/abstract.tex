% Context: Why now
\noindent\textbf{Context:}
The ability to observe associations between microbes and their hosts usually does not, in itself, support conclusions regarding the ecological nature of those interactions. Even when an association is correlated with an outcome (a disease state, for example) under carefully controlled conditions, there are usually many potentially confounding factors. For example, variations in host genotype, phenotype and association with other microbial organisms complicate the ability to establish cause and effect.
