\section{Discussion}

Some form of co-diversification is probably inevitable in almost any situation in which multiple species remain in ecological contact over evolutionary time. As a result, it is a fairly well-studied topic. 

{\em Given that co-diversification is known to have occurred, what is the most likely history?}

{\em Given a system in which co-diversification may have occurred, what is the likelihood that it did?}

{\em Given a system in which there are many opportunities where co-diversification may have occurred, which cases are the most likely?}

\subsection{Phylogenetic signal and trait-based approaches}

%Here are some papers that examine the gut microbiome of fish, including African cichlids.

For each organism that appears among the microbioms of a group of hosts, there exists a pattern of observed associations between the ``guest'' organism and the host organisms. These associations can be treated as traits of the host, and the history of each association can be examined like any phenotypic trait. Alternatively, the tendency to associate (or not) with a host could be treated as a trait distributed over a group of microbial organisms, although it is difficult to imagine how one might demarcate the boundaries between groups. Association with a particular host is more likely to correspond to different traits for more distantly related bacteria, and so it is probably not meaningful to naively apply stochastic trait mapping across all bacterial diversity.

In {\em Analysis of phylogenetics and evolution with {\tt R}} (p. 236), Emmanuael Paradis describes phylogenetic signal as follows :

\begin{quote}
The concept of phylogenetic signal is at the heart of most phylogenetic methods. From a statistical point of view, a phylogenetic signal is defined by the non-null covariances (i.e., non-independence) among species. From a biological point of view, phylogenetic signal is a direct consequence of the evolution of traits and its form will depend on the evolutionary mechanisms in action.
\end{quote}

The advantage of this approach is that it decomposes the problem into a large number of smaller problems. Every OTU is treated as an independent trait, and observed associations are simply plugged into one of the four established models. All of them have been implemented in {\tt R}. Unfortunately, this is also a key disadvantage. Most trait-based models do not account for interactions {\em among} traits, or a way to account for traits that have their own evolutionary model, independent of the organisms that exhibit them. 

A second disadvantage of trait-based approaches when applied to co-diversifying systems arises from the non-uniform distribution of microbial diversity with respect to 16S diversity. Individual OTUs may represent several organisms, each with their own pattern of association (Figure \ref{fig:FP_fig4}). Comparing phylogenetic signal among different OTUs thus depends on the diversity underlying each of the OTUs. Correcting for this would require a relatively complete and unbiased survey of microbial diversity.

\subsection{Permutation tests for cospeciation}

One of the classic datasets for cospeciation methods is probably the paper by 
Hafner {\em et al.} from 1994 in which they look at the relationship between pocket
gophers and the lice that specialize. 

%* [Hafner, M. S. et al. Disparate rates of molecular evolution in cospeciating hosts and parasites. *Science (New York, N.Y.)* (1994).](http://www.calpoly.edu/~bio/LMOE/pdfs/Hafner%20et%20al.%201994.pdf)

I was sort of interested in trying this randomization-based method by Balbuena 
{\em et al.}, but Michael Turelli thinks the method may be lousy (``{\em ad hoc}'') and 
that null hypothesis (hosts and parasites independently evolving).

%* [Balbuena, J. A., Míguez-Lozano, R. & Blasco-Costa, I. PACo: A novel procrustes application to cophylogenetic analysis. *PLoS ONE* (2013).](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061048)

Turelli suggested this paper by Huelsenbeck {\em et al.} which uses a Bayesian
framework to analyze the same data. In this paper, the null hypothesis is that
host and parasite evolution is parallel, and they look for likely violations
(i.e., host-switching events).

%* [Huelsenbeck, J. P., Rannala, B. & Larget, B. A bayesian framework for the analysis of cospeciation. *Evolution* (2000).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10937213)

Later on, I found that {\tt scikit-bio} implements a function called {\tt hommola\_cospeciation} %[`hommola_cospeciation`](http://scikit-bio.org/docs/latest/generated/generated/skbio.stats.evolve.hommola_cospeciation.html),
which led me to this paper :

%* A Permutation Test of Host–Parasite Cospeciation. Molecular Biology and Evolution, Vol. 26, No. 7. (01 July 2009), pp. 1457-1468, by Kerstin Hommola, Judith E. Smith, Yang Qiu, Walter R. Gilks

Hommola {\em et al.} describe a method extends the Mantel test. \cite{mantel1967detection} The Mantel test
requires matrixes of identical dimensions, and so when it is used for 
co-speciation, the two trees must have the same number of memembers. When
they don't, past studies have deleted or duplicated taxa, which results in
anomalous results (the paper makes a direct comparison to such methods).
To address this issue, Hommola {\em et al.} \cite{hommola2009permutation} propose an approach that measures
correlations like the Mantel test, but does not require identical matrix
dimensions. They then couple this with a straightforward permutation test 
to estimate the significance of the correlations.

The null hypothesis being tested is that the two groups of organisms have
evolved independently, which seems appropriate when attempting to *identify*
examples of co-speciation among the organisms found in a microbiome. 

What we undertake here is to build a tree of all OTUs associated with our
fish. We then construct a link matrix from the OTU counts by applying a
threshold on relative abundance. Then, we traverse the OTU tree, generating
trees for each clade of OTUs, and subsetting the link matrix to the OTUs
present. Taken with the host phylogeny, the {\tt hommola\_cospeciation} method 
from {\tt scikit-bio} is applied to these three pieces of data, yielding a 
Pearson's correlation and a $p$-value based on the permutation test for 
each clade of OTUs in the OTU tree.

This approach leaves natural history of the association unexplored. However,
now that we've used Hommola's test to reject most parts of the OTU tree, it
should be possible to apply Huelsenbeck *et al.* to the much smaller OTU 
clades that show statistically significant phylogenetic concordance. There
are other tests that may be intersting, though, such as the `TreeKO` method
implemented in {\tt ete2} %[`ete2`](http://etetoolkit.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial_phylogeny.html#treeko-splitting-gene-trees-into-species-trees) :
