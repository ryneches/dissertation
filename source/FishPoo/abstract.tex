\section{Abstract}

As a single lineage evolves and branches into a group of distinct new
lineages, it is said to diversify. However, it is rarely the case that
this process occurs in isolation; evolving lineages interact with one
another with varying intensity over time. When the histories of
interacting lineages are inferred, their phylogenies resemble ``tangled
trees.'' Most existing methods for studying these systems fall into two
categories; either they test for codiversification by fitting data to
an idealized model, or in cases where codiversification is known to
have occurred, they endeavour to predict the most likely history.
Here, we present a comparative approach to codiversification. Using
the graph spectra of networks of interacting organisms, we construct a
similarity metric that permits the use of established clustering and
machine learning techniques to classify interactions that exhibit
similar phylogenetic and ecological structures. Using this method, we
are able to propose roles for unidentified host-associated bacterial
clades based on the similarity of their interactions with their hosts
to ecological interactions where the roles are known.
