\section{Acknowledgments}

For the insight that provided the mathematical foundation of this work, the authors would like to thank Kerstin Hommola, Judith E. Smith, Yang Qiu and Walter R. Gilks.

For their work gathering and assembling the literature survey of plant visitor, plant pollinator and frugivory interactions, and for sharing their data and answering questions, the authors would like to thank Enrico Rezende, Jessica Lavabre, Paulo Guimar{\~a}es, Pedro Jordano and Jordi Bascompte.

For providing permanent homes and breeding opportunities for the animals used in this study, the authors would like to thank the Sacramento Aquarium Society, and Richard Bireley in particular.

For the expressive shrug that sent me down this line of research, I would like to thank Karl Otto Stetter.

For inspiring my interest in this topic in the first place, and for being generally inspirational and awesome, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Rachel J. Whitaker.

% For the risk he took by inviting me into his lab, for his patient tolerance of my folly and stubbornness throughout this journey, for his sacrifices to protect my intellectual freedom, for his encouragement, for his levity and his seriousness, for his irreverence in the face of the trivial and his reverence for the truly profound, for the burden of genuine compassion for others that he refuses to lay down, for his gleeful sprints to understanding and for his reluctant walks to judgment, I thank Jonathan A. Eisen. I have had the privilege to live and work within the safe, quiet space outlined by the bow shock of an advisor who stands against the current of prejudice and cruelty. There are none equal.
